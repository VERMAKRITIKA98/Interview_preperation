Disappear till DECEMBER 2025 and…

And crack all DSA Rounds.

Here’s HOW you can do it in 5 steps:

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟭: 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹𝘀
Time & Space Complexity (Big-O, Big-Theta, Big-Omega)
Recursion Basics (Base Case, Recursive Relations)
Iterative vs Recursive Approaches
Problem-Solving Mindset → Brute Force to Optimized

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟮: 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗧𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗰𝘀
Arrays & Strings → Prefix Sum, Sliding Window, Two-Pointers
Linked Lists → Reversal, Cycle Detection, Merge
Stacks & Queues → Monotonic Stack, Deques, LRU Cache
Hashing → Frequency Maps, Sets, Prefix Hashing

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟯: 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗰𝘀
Trees → Binary Trees, BST, DFS, BFS, LCA
Heaps & Priority Queues → Top-K Problems, Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Graphs → BFS, DFS, Shortest Path, Union-Find
Dynamic Programming → 1D/2D DP, Knapsack, DP on Strings

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟰: 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻-𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴
Identify Patterns → Sliding Window, Binary Search on Answer
Reuse Templates → Backtracking, DP States, Greedy Choices
Practice Leetcode/Codeforces Problem Sets by Patterns

𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟱: 𝗠𝗼𝗰𝗸𝘀 & 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻
Solve real interview questions in time-bound mode
Analyze mistakes → Optimize solutions
Take mock interviews to simulate pressure
Keep refining weak areas

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Sliding Window)
Product of Array Except Self
Rotate Matrix (2D Array)
Next Greater Element (Monotonic Stack)
Detect Cycle in Linked List (Floyd’s Algorithm)
Implement LRU Cache (HashMap + Doubly Linked List)
Binary Tree → Level Order Traversal (BFS)
Binary Search → Find First and Last Occurrence

Hard (10 Questions)
Trapping Rain Water (Two-Pointer / Stack)
Minimum Window Substring (Sliding Window)
Word Break Problem (DP)
Longest Increasing Subsequence (DP)
